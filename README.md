ReStart

## Day 4

- `Time & Space Complexity`: This episode introduces Big O notation, helping you understand how code performance scales with input size. A must-watch for preparing DSA interviews. (1 Video(1.5x speed) - Start - 9/12/2025 -10:32 AM - 11:20 AM - 9/15/2025 -8:00 AM - END - 8:43 AM)

## Day 3

- Under Warm Up:

  - 8:00 AM -> `Count Digit` - This episode teaches how to count digits in a number using loops and mathematical operations. It enhances your understanding of basic number manipulation. - Done by 8:21 AM.
  - 8:24 AM -> `Palindrome` - Learn to write code that checks if a given input reads the same forwards and backwards (palindrome). Essential for understanding string and number handling - Leetcode - [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/) - Done by 8:51 AM.
  - 8:55 AM -> `Reverse Integer` - This video teaches how to reverse an integer's digits without converting it to a string. Great for practicing loops and modulus operations. - Done by 9:11 AM.

## Day 2

- Under Warm Up:
  - 9:04 AM -> `Loops 02` - Explore complex looping scenarios, including nested loops and edge cases. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and help you tackle repetitive tasks in code. - Done at 10:17 AM with a 10 min break in-between.
  - Take a break before you start next video - give rest to your eyes as well.
  - 11:20 AM -> `Second largest` - Learn how to write code to find the second largest element in a list or array. Improve your understanding of comparisons and iterations in arrays. -> done at 12:12 PM
  - 1:52PM -> `Loop in Loop` - This video focuses on using loops within loops (nested loops) to solve problems like pattern generation and multi-dimensional data handling. -> 2:18 PM (2x speed) - a great foundation for star patterns we will do them for fun next.
  - 4:01 PM -> `Star Pattern` - Learn how to create various star-based patterns (pyramids, inverted patterns) using nested loops. A fun way to practice loops and understand iteration. ->(1.5x speed) Done by 5:30 PM (slept in-between for 10-20 min) but had fun.

## Day 1

- Day 1 - Revision of Basics & some insights on how to approach DSA
- Introduction from Akshay Saini on what to expect from this journey & I am committed to Work on this and share my journey EOD solving "at least" 1 problem each day. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7371418723288584192-HRiO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACPeyxkBonrLXm1cT_CSwVkX1QTcKmY9BK0) & Making my own notes.
- Under Warm Up:
  - `Programming 101 using JavaScript` - This video introduces fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, and syntax to set a strong foundation for learning DSA - will be practicing on [NamasteDevPlayGround](https://namastedev.com/playground)
  - `Functions,if-else` - Understand how to use functions and control flow with if-else statements in programming. Learn to write modular code and control program execution efficiently. **`I'm Having Fun`**
  - `Loops 01` - This video explains how to use for-loops and while-loops in programming to repeat tasks. Gain insights into loop control and iteration patterns.
