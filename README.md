# NamasteDSA

- Learning from NamasteDev - [NamasteDSA](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-dsa)
- Going to watch every video in order & at 1.5x speed if i'm aware of concepts already.

## Day 2

- Under Warm Up:
  - 9:04 AM -> `Loops 02` - Explore complex looping scenarios, including nested loops and edge cases. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and help you tackle repetitive tasks in code. - Done at 10:17 AM with a 10 min break in-between.
  - Take a break before you start next video - give rest to your eyes as well.
  - 11:20 AM -> `Second largest` - Learn how to write code to find the second largest element in a list or array. Improve your understanding of comparisons and iterations in arrays. -> done at 12:12 PM
  - 1:52PM -> `Loop in Loop` - This video focuses on using loops within loops (nested loops) to solve problems like pattern generation and multi-dimensional data handling. -> 2:18 PM (2x speed) - a great foundation for star patterns we will do them for fun next.
  - 4:01 PM -> `Star Pattern` - Learn how to create various star-based patterns (pyramids, inverted patterns) using nested loops. A fun way to practice loops and understand iteration. ->(1.5x speed) Done by 5:30 PM (slept in-between for 10-20 min) but had fun.

## Day 1

- Day 1 - Revision of Basics & some insights on how to approach DSA
- Introduction from Akshay Saini on what to expect from this journey & I am committed to Work on this and share my journey EOD solving "at least" 1 problem each day.

- Under Warm Up:
  - `Programming 101 using JavaScript` - This video introduces fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, and syntax to set a strong foundation for learning DSA - will be practicing on [NamasteDevPlayGround](https://namastedev.com/playground)
  - `Functions,if-else` - Understand how to use functions and control flow with if-else statements in programming. Learn to write modular code and control program execution efficiently. **`I'm Having Fun`**
  - `Loops 01` - This video explains how to use for-loops and while-loops in programming to repeat tasks. Gain insights into loop control and iteration patterns.
